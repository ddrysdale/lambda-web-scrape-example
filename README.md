#Example AWS Lambda web scraper
 This example implementation I have is an AWS Lambda function using Phantom.js and Cheerio. Iâ€™m pulling jobs from the Amazon careers site.

# Deploy
To deploy to AWS Lambda, we need to build the project in a Linux enviroment.

Run build.sh & upload the generated ZIP to S3
